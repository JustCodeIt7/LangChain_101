# LangChain_101

Code and examples for the YouTube series on LangChain.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and other resources related to learning and experimenting with the LangChain library.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

*   **`01-Models/`**: Explores different aspects of Language Models (LLMs) in LangChain, including:
    *   `01-LLMs/`: Basic usage of LLMs.
    *   `02_Prompt_Templates/`: Working with prompt templates.
    *   `03_Output_Parsing/`: Parsing the output from LLMs.
    *   `04-Serialization/`: Saving and loading LangChain objects.
*   **`02-Data-Connections/`**: Focuses on connecting LangChain to various data sources:
    *   `data/`: Sample data files used in the notebooks.
    *   `chroma/`, `db/`, `faiss/`: Directories related to vector stores and databases.
    *   Notebooks covering data loaders, text splitters, embeddings, vector stores, retrievers, multi-vector retrievers, and context compression.
*   **`03-LCEL/`**: Demonstrates the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for building chains.
*   **`04-Indexing/`**: Covers indexing strategies in LangChain.
*   **`04-Memory/`**: Explores how to add memory to LangChain applications.
*   **`LangChain_Apps/`**: Contains example applications built with LangChain:
    *   `LangChain_Doc_Summerization/`: An application for summarizing documents.

## Getting Started

(To be added: Instructions on how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the examples.)

## Usage

Each directory contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) that demonstrate specific LangChain functionalities. You can explore these files to understand how to use different components of the library.
